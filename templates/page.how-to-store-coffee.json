            "content": "<p>In general, the following applies to coffee: the fresher, the better. And the warmer the place of storage, the faster the aroma dissipates. Coffee is very sensitive, external influences such as light, heat, oxygen and moisture are poison for the coffee aroma. Therefore, coffee should always be stored in a cool, dark and dry place. If the coffee comes into contact with oxygen or heat during storage, it loses its aromas more quickly, because these come mainly from the oils in the bean, which die more quickly to oxidize even at room temperature. This will make the oils rancid, which can lead to a bad aftertaste. An opaque container that can be sealed airtight is ideal for storage. A tightly sealed coffee can keeps coffee beans or powder fresh for longer and also guarantees the coffee aroma longer than storing in the opened package. Put the coffeein the aroma can with the packaging.<\/p>",
